# Moving-Average-Trading-Bot

A 3 moving average trading bot with top down analysis operating on multiple time frames and includes a news filter to filter out unpredictable market conditions. There are 3 primary symbols I would recommend this metatrader5 EA for:
GOLD
BITCOIN
NAS100

You can use any settings you find most apropriate for your trading style and current situation and conditions, although I have found the best settings so far to be as folllows:
GOLD:

Now, as for the results there are a few important points to not beforehand. I have started the account off with 500 dollars and a leverage of 200/500 as this is what I believe most people would be comfortable starting off with. Note that the leverage chosen does not imcrease your risk so long as you are using the built in feature I have added that actumatically calculates lot size based of the persentage of your balance you are prepared to risk per trade(so a ligher leverage would probibly be better). Although I have started the account with 500 dollars, more would be better , as Gold and Bitcoin are particularly expensive to buy. I am using 3 months ( 2025/02/05 - 2025/05/05) of past data with 100% accurate real tick historical data, meaning results are very accurate. It is possible to preform a longer backtest but results will not be accurate and it is very important to not that historical data that is not 100% accurate scews results vastly. I have created bots that return millions with unbelievable results based on a backtest but preform horribly in real life conditions, this is why it is important to use historical data that is 100% accurate based on real ticks.

As for the results:
